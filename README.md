# DataBaste
#### A collaborative project by: Ben Fox, Yi Jiang, Margaret Morehead, Shawn Padilla, Meghan Tanguay

## Abstract
DataBaste is a recipe search application built upon a database of ingredients, recipes, and flavor profiles, allowing users a more optimized and personalized search experience.  Data was web scraped from AllRecipes and FlavorDB in order to fill in the database.  Queries originally written in MySQL were translated into Java, which was used to connect the database in MySQL with the JDBC API.  A simple and clean user interface was produced using Java Swing.
